# SecretOldManJenkins
 
# Objective:

Students will practice servers and node modules by creating a puzzle game that uses the url as the answer check

 

# Instructions: 

The box that you uncovered in the yard had a magic tome that told of an ancient being that is destined to destroy the earth very soon, Uncle Jenkins was into some strange stuff. Just as you are about to close the book and put it away, a photo falls out with a shadowy figure standing in the center. As you pick it up, strange images and symbols flash across your mind. You feel cloudy, and the room starts to feel foggy. 

 

You wake up later in the night with a strange and uncomfortable feeling surrounding your thoughts; you begin to recall the circumstances that led you to be on the floor. You see the book and the photo on the ground near you, but something is wrong. You clearly remember the figure standing in the photo, but now, when you look, nothing is standing there. 

 

As you scoop up the book and photo and make your way down the stairs. The front door is wide open, but you know you are locked up. You walk up to relock it, expecting the annoying neighbor to be the culprit, but as you look out into the distance, you see the shadowy figure slowly fade into the night through the trees. 

 

You have to do something; you just unleashed something into the world, and you don’t know where to start to fix it. You begin creating a secret organization, and you need a way to check the problem-solving and fortitude of potential members. You will create a puzzle site, and only the final screen will welcome the user to the group. 

 

You need to create 6 puzzles and use the url as the answer. 

# For example:

I could put - - - . . . - - - on the page
The answer would be localhost:3000/sos
OR  think | you act
The answer would be localhost:3000/thinkbeforeyouact
 

# Make sure you have:

 A welcome page that tells them they are here to solve a puzzle
At least 6 puzzles
A final page welcoming them to the secret society
A hint page for each puzzle to get a clue like sos/hint would give a hint to the next puzzle
NO LINKS THEY MUST TYPE IN THE RIGHT URL FROM THE PUZZLES
Consistent url naming convention i.e. camelCase, under_score, alllowercase …
Lastly is there an answer key for me to grade you. 
 

Everything will be unstyled and done through a local node server.




# Next Level: (EXTRA CREDIT) +15

Create a few more puzzles that require js programming to solve. 
For example what is the 1000 number in the fibonacci sequence
Add index.html files to your pages and style them with a little css
Create a name and slogan for your new society
 

# Deliverables: 

The js code that you made
The answer key 
Should have the puzzle, hint, answer, and url for each one so I can be sure you did the work.
